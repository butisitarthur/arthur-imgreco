In the arthur-imgreco directory you find my image reocgnition server built with openCV. I would like you to evaluate the entire codebase and create a new repository in the arthur-imgreco-2 directory and build an entirely new image recognition server that adheres to the following requirements:

1. Written in Python
2. The API should use FastAPI and provide the same or similar endpoints as my current server, but you are free to add more.
3. We should rely on opensource technologies
4. We should use the most recent and advanced technology available in 2025, probably a Vector Similarity Search using PyTorch or Tensorflow
5. The image recognition capabilities should be able to scale up to multiple millions of images
6. We should include unit testing
7. We should include a README.md with detailed instructions on how to:
    1. Set up the server locally, with Docker or without
    2. Deploy the server
    3. what kind of database we'll need
    4. Any other information required to get it running

Before you write one line of code, please provide your suggested tech stack for me to review and approve.
